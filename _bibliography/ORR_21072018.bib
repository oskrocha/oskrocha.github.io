	Abstract = {Educational quizzes are useful not only to evaluate or test the knowledge acquired by a learner, but also to help her/him to deepen knowledge about a specific domain or topic in an informal and entertaining way. The production of quizzes is a time-consuming task that can be automated by taking advantage of existing knowledge bases available on the Web of Linked Open Data (LOD). However, automatically extracting from the LOD a knowledge graph composed by the information of a set of resources which are relevant to a given specific domain or topic, is a crucial phase for the automatic generation of quizzes.},

	Abstract = {The core business of Mobile Network Operators (MNO) has moved from network management and phone services to service providing. In contrast to Information Communication Technology (ICT) service providers, MNOs handle large amounts of their customers' context data and generated content, which can be used to bring value-added services to customers and therefore, generate solid revenues. Given this scenario, this paper describes how Telecom Italia (a major Italian MNO) has prototyped such type of services after a deep research performed in the context-awareness and context management field and using its user-generated content management facilities in federation with other platforms and systems.},

	Abstract = {Access control is a recognized open issue when interacting with RDF using HTTP methods. In literature, authentication and authorization mechanisms either introduce undesired complexity such as SPARQL and ad-hoc policy languages, or rely on basic access control lists, thus resulting in limited policy expressiveness. In this paper we show how the Shi3ld attribute-based authorization framework for SPARQL endpoints has been progressively converted to protect HTTP operations on RDF. We proceed by steps: we start by supporting the SPARQL 1.1 Graph Store Protocol, and we shift towards a SPARQL-less solution for the Linked Data Platform. We demonstrate that the resulting authorization framework provides the same functionalities of its SPARQL-based counterpart, including the adoption of Semantic Web languages only.},

@article{aconceptrec,
	Abstract = {Conventionally, the Web Service [1], respecting the Client-Server paradigm, consists of a software system or a platform running as a server somewhere in the Internet allowing its customers to benefit from it through the use of a client. Cloud computing [2] (which has gained a lot of popularity in recent years), allows to have this software system or platform deployed and running in a flexible and robust environment where traffic demand is automatically handled and the faulttolerance and high-availability are provided by the cloud tools and means. However, currently existing private and public cloud models comprise cloud platforms installed on IT facilities located in certain geographical areas. Thus, the final customer location is not considered and the service traffic is not balanced geographically. This is a serious drawback of the existing technology as it creates an overhead of the network (Internet) traffic for the service when the customers use it from different geographical areas. Moreover this increases service delays as the packets in the request-response communication paradigm cross long Internet cross-countries connections and thus delayed. The new concept proposed in this paper is feasible due to the EU attempt to instantiate a number of the public clouds interconnected into a cloud federation over Europe, where the deploying of services in a geographically distributed cloud environment will enable to serve customers in a more efficient and faster way. The location of the customer connected through the network (Internet) will define to which service instance in the federated cloud, its requests will be sent to. This drastically reduces service traffic, and so the costs, over Internet for international traveling customers, makes the service reaction faster as it balances the service traffic over mode nodes and makes significantly more robust overall service solution because of the service geographical redundancy. The recommender service described in this paper is deployed over few nodes of the federated clouds build and interconnected as result of the EU funded PPP XIFI project[3].},

The CloudWave EU project, has the objective of contributing to these underdeveloped concepts by introducing a Feedback-Driven Development (FDD) approach during the development and a Coordinated Adaptation (CA) concept to control the execution by adapting the application or service behavior and its cloud environment accordingly to the execution context and condition changes. This paper describes the CloudWave concept as well as its architecture. Similarly, the initial implementation of the project is detailed. Additionally, it is shown how the project can be implemented in the Telco sector and the benefits and advantages that it offers.},

	Abstract = {Nowadays the IT Clouds are used to provide services and run applications (in a flexible and scalable way) where the entire lifecycle of the application or service is under the control of the Cloud Management Subsystem that is able to automatically and autonomously start, stop, restart a server or an application. Additionally, it is able to determine when a certain application or service is running under overload conditions and reduce the load by adding additional virtual machines hosting the affected software or releasing the resources not used anymore. These are classic operations performed by nowadays Clouds. However little effort has been dedicated to support a developer during the application development process or during the service execution by changing the application behavior dependently on the service's components response and availability. The Cloud Wave project founded by the European Commission within the FP7 Research Program aims to contribute on these underdeveloped concepts. It contributes to the development process of a service or application in a feedback-driven way and also to the service execution by adapting the service accordingly to the execution environment and condition changes.},

	Abstract = {Recommender systems (RS) are software tools that use analytic technologies to suggest different items of interest to an end user. Linked Data is a set of best practices for publishing and connecting structured data on the Web. This paper presents a systematic literature review to summarize the state of the art in RS that use structured data published as Linked Data for providing recommendations of items from diverse domains. It considers the most relevant research problems addressed and classifies RS according to how Linked Data have been used to provide recommendations. Furthermore, it analyzes contributions, limitations, application domains, evaluation techniques, and directions proposed for future research. We found that there are still many open challenges with regard to RS based on Linked Data in order to be efficient for real applications. The main ones are personalization of recommendations, use of more datasets considering the heterogeneity introduced, creation of new hybrid RS for adding information, definition of more advanced similarity measures that take into account the large amount of data in Linked Data datasets, and implementation of testbeds to study evaluation techniques and to assess the accuracy scalability and computational complexity of RS.

On the one hand, this conception reduces the limitations for the creation of new Web Services capable of operating on top of the large Internet technological foundation, while on the other it has some drawbacks such as: slow creation process, long time-to-market, deep knowledge of many Internet Technologies, no standardization, no interoperability and no quality control. All the aforementioned characteristics lead to a strong fragmentation of technology and Web Services. The Future Internet initiative instantiation by European Commission in form of Private-Public Partnership (PPP) Program has the objective to populate Internet with common conceptual components (Generic Enablers or GE) to enable a faster and interoperable service creation. FI-WARE is the technological core foundation project of the PPP program that provides specifications and reference implementations of the most common generic enablers and deploys them on its test-bed for public and evaluation usage. The Publish/Subscribe and the Semantic Annotation GEs that the project has provided and installed in the FI-WARE test-bed are demonstrated in this paper.},

This is the era of new Internet services over the top, without requiring specific changes or specific functionalities from the ``old'' version of Internet. This, on one side, does not pose any limitations for the creation of new services able to build and offer on top of the large Internet technological foundation. On the other side, this way of ``do it (everything) by yourself'' has its drawbacks, such as slow creation process, long time-to-market, deep knowledge of many technologies on top of Internet, no standardization, no interoperability, solutions created by different people, and many other typical limitations of free but complex individual development.

	interfacing the information available from many publishers with heterogeneous

	include new actors into the services, increase the service offers
	and increment the world-wide and cross-domain usage of services based

	Future Internet open standard technology to be adopted and used in
	any application domain by any customer for any needs. The reference
	open standard chosen is OMA's NGSI. The open standard based technological

	the output of these elements. We call those rules as Smart Space

@article{EmergencySituations,
	Abstract = {Abstract: The concept of Emergency Telecommunications (EMTEL) addresses
	a broad spectrum of aspects related to the provisioning of telecommunications
	services in emergency situations; these can range from an individual
	in a state of personal emergency (with need to make an emergency
	call due to sudden illness, traffic accident, outbreak of fire at
	home) to a very broad perspective of serious disruptions (earthquakes,
	floods, terrorist attacks, etc.). The concept also covers the telecommunications
	needs of public safety resources, like: police, firefighters, ambulances
	and other medical services. Such services usually rely on dedicated
	networks and equipments, often different for different services.
	Leveraging on pervasive mobile technologies and context-aware systems
	it is possible to realize such critical services on large public
	telecommunications networks. We designed and implemented PICO (control
	platforms and delivery of services in converged networks), an innovative
	Context-Aware solution for service delivery and management of emergency
	situations. The Context-Aware platform for fixed-mobile convergence
	is based on IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) platform and application
	streaming on Android OS. Thanks to the PICO platform we were able
	to implement customized context-aware emergency services with demanding
	performance requirements on top of a public IMS infrastructure. The
	PICO platform enables the integration of context-aware emergency
	services but some works are needed for minimizing energy consumption.},
