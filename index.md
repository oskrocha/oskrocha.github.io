I'm a Research Engineer currently working at the [Inria Sophia-Antipolis](http://www.inria.fr/centre/sophia) research center for the [WIMMICS](http://wimmics.inria.fr) team.

I'm mainly interested in **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, more specifically in **Knowledge Representation (KR)** in the Semantic Web. I am currently focused on the automatic generation of educational quizzes using Semantic Web technologies and Linked Data. My interests and experience also include **Machine Learning** and **Recommendation Systems**.

I worked previously at the [Politecnico di Torino](http://www.polito.it) in Italy for the [SoftEng](http://softeng.polito.it) research group as postdoc researcher.

I hold a PhD in Information and Systems Engineering obtained from the Politecnico di Torino in Italy, my thesis was about how to improve mobile services by applying Semantic Web technologies and exploiting Linked Data, Context Awareness and User-Generated Content, it was part of a collabration with the [Telecom Italiaâ€™s](http://www.telecomitalia.com/tit/en/about-us/business/activities/telecom-italia-lab.html) Context Awareness research group.
