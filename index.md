I'm currently the head of Data Science & AI at <i class="fa fa-rocket"></i> [Teach on Mars](https://www.teachonmars.com/) <i class="fa fa-rocket"></i>. I'm  mainly interested in AI in education, concretely on:

- Knowledge Representation and Reasoning
- Semantic Web and Linked Data
- Machine Learning - Graph Representation Learning (GRL)
- Recommender Systems


I'm an external collaborator of [WIMMICS](http://wimmics.inria.fr), a joint research team between [Inria Sophia-Antipolis](http://www.inria.fr/centre/sophia) Sophia Antipolis - Méditerranée and [I3S](https://www.i3s.unice.fr) (CNRS and Université Côte d'Azur), where I worked for almost 5 years doing research on AI in education. I also worked previously as a postdoc researcher at the [Politecnico di Torino](http://www.polito.it) in Italy for the [SoftEng](http://softeng.polito.it) research group and I hold a PhD in Information and Systems Engineering obtained also from the Politecnico di Torino.
