# Personal website

This is the source code of my [personal website](http://oscarrodriguez.me). It was created using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and the gorgeous [kactus](https://github.com/nickbalestra/kactus) theme.
To create the « publications » section, I used the [jekyll-scholar](https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar) plugin.

Feel free to reuse my code for your own personal website.
